# DevOps Challenge â€“ Kubernetes Environment with Jenkins, PostgreSQL, Grafana, and Traefik

This project sets up a full DevOps stack using Minikube. It includes:
- Jenkins with dynamic Kubernetes agents
- PostgreSQL as the database
- Grafana and Prometheus for monitoring
- Traefik as the ingress controller

---

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Minikube
- kubectl
- Helm
- Docker
- Terraform

---

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/cx-or-carmeli/DevOps-Challenge-Or.git
cd DevOps-Challenge-Or
```

2. Run the deployment script:
```bash
./deployment.sh install
```

3. Add the following to your `/etc/hosts` file:
```

## Architecture Overview

This project deploys:

- Jenkins with Kubernetes plugin for dynamic agents
- PostgreSQL with persistent storage
- Grafana and Prometheus for dashboards and metrics
- Traefik as a LoadBalancer Ingress for routing to services

---

## Future Improvements

- Add resource limits and probes in manifests
- Integrate GitHub Actions or Jenkinsfile for CI/CD
- Improve observability with custom Grafana dashboards

---

## Notes

This project demonstrates infrastructure as code, container orchestration, and observability in a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.
